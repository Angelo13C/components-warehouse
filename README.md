# Components warehouse
This is a full-stack application for managing an inventory of electronic components.
The frontend is built with Angular, while the backend is powered by Node.js and Loopback4. This system allows users to categorize and store electronic components efficiently using tags.

## Explanation
Each component, referred to as an "item", is composed of multiple tags (e.g 1K, 1n, Resistor, Capacitor, 25V, 50V). For example if an item is composed of the tags Capacitor, 1n, 25V it means that it is a capacitor of 1nF that can withstand 25V max.
The drawers are the boxes in which items are stored. In the future, I plan to build a physical system where the drawers are 3D printed, with an easy way to find the components in the drawers based on some input from the user.

## Demo
Here's a video on how it works:
